# Database-based assessment


Instructions:  
To set up a cinema seat reservation software, model the expected database.  
Design the UML class diagram or a Conceptual Data Model.  
Transcribe this physical schema into SQL tables populated with dummy data using an RDBMS (e.g., MariaDB, PostgreSQL), and know how to export it for the sponsor. 
  

Modalities/Restrictions:  
 - Model the database in the form of a CDM or UML class diagram.
 - Write the various secure SQL scripts for creating the database/its tables, as well as the relationships and constraints between them.
 - Populate the tables with dummy data (always using SQL commands).
 - Explain in the project description a process for backing up the complete database.

Work is to be done solely in the terminal or an IDE.
